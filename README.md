## Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring software engineer from Singapore. Currently, I am a sophomore at Yale-NUS College Majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. While I'm more passionate about Mathematics, I don't mind myself some good side projects once in a while. Do go to <a href="https://www.kzhaoyuan.com">kzhaoyuan.com</a> if you want to find out more about me!

In terms of technical skills, I am familiar with React for front-end and am working towards proficiency for Flask for back-end. Hit me up if you find my skillsets compatible!
